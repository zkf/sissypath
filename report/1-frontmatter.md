## Abstract ##

In this report we look at the problem of evacuation planning as the problem of finding a path through a graph.
We also make connections to the theory of Markovian decision processes.
The most interesting path finding algorithm discussed in this paper is the application of the UCB1 algorithm, known from the multi-armed bandit problem domain.
